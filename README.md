**The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (Receita Federal)** provides free public data on **50+ million Brazilian companies (CNPJs)**. These are **tens of GBs of CSV files** that must be:

✓ Downloaded and processed monthly
✓ Normalized (CNAE codes, municipalities, legal nature)
✓ Related (companies + establishments + partners/shareholders)
✓ Transformed into value (aggregations, dataset joins, data cleaning, etc.)
